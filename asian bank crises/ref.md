The event of a banking crisis occuring in Asian countries is evaluated by analysing historic macroeconomic events that corrrelated with such banking crises.
The following approaches have been used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Neural Network
For binary classification, we use logarithmic loss function (binary_crossentropy) during training, along with sigmoid activation.
The model also uses the efficient Adam optimization algorithm for gradient boost.
